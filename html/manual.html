	  <p>
	    You can change between both modes, for all your ships,
	    pressing the "a" key for manual mode and
	    pressing the "i" key to back to the
	    automatic mode.<p>
	    
	  <p> Only one ship can be change between these modes at a
	    time. Inside a planet this special ship is drawn with
	    white color. In the free space this ship is shown with
	    the radar centred on it.
	    
	  <p> In manual mode you can control every ship independly
	    with the keyboard. To turn the ship use the left and right
	    arrow keys. To accelerate, the up key arrow. SPACE to
	    fire. 1,2,3 to change armor.
	  <p>
	    In automatic mode, the ship follows your orders,
	    except in the following cases:
	    
	    <ul>
	      <li>If an enemy ship is near then attack.
	      <li>If it is close to asteroids, goes to them.
	      <li>If it has few fuel or no ammunition goes to the
		nearest ally planet.
	      <li>When landed, doesn't take off until it reaches a
		minimum amount of fuel and ammunition.
	    </ul>

	    When the exceptions finish, it will continue with the given
	    order.
	    
	   <p> Especial orders:
	     <ul>
	  <li>STOP:<br>

	    If the ship is in outer space: stop, doesn't accelerate but can fire. <br>

	    Inner a planet: first land and stay on ground, doesn't take
            off but can fire. Never take off.<br>

	    The order STOP is applied except in the next case: 

	    <ul>
	    <li>if the ship has low ammunition, low fuel or is very
	    damaged it goes to the nearest ally planet.
	    </ul>

	    <li> RETREAT:<br> 
	      The ship will go to the nearest ally planet without
	      attack any enemy or asteroid.

	    <h3>Selecting a ship:</h3>
	    
	  <p>
	    There several ways of selecting a ship:
	    <ol>

		among all your ships. "Ctrl-Tab" inverts
		the order.
	      <li>Pressing "PageDown" selects a ship in
		the next planet. "PageUp" in the
		previous one.
	      <li>Pressing "Home" selects the first
		spaceship in outer space.
	      <li>Using the order command SELECT and introducing
		the ship ID.
	      <li>With mouse in map view or inner a planet. Left click
	      selects the nearest ship to mouse pointer.
	      <li>There are four rapid access key to select ships:
		F1, F2, F3 and F4.  If you press Ctrl-F1 the
		actual selected ship is assigned to the key F1,
		etc...
	    </ol>
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Selecting multiple ships:</h3>
	  <p>
	    In the map view or inner a planet, you can select
	    various ships with the mouse. The next order will
	    affect to all of them. Simply, click with the left
	    mouse button and, without release it, drag and select
	    the region you want. All ships into that region will
	    be selected. 
	  <p>
	    You can select multiple individual ships keeping the
	    "ctrl" key pressed.
	  <p>
	    If you select a planet in the map view, all spaceships
	    inside the planet will be selected.
	  <p>
	    The color of the selected ships will be grey.

	    available or not. At level 0 only the shots are
	    available. The fighter have two more weapons: missile
	    at level 1 and laser at level 2. All the ships
	    increase their weapons strength and their shields when
	    pass to the next level.<br>  In manual mode you can

	    <h3>Experience and Levels:</h3>
	    
	    Ships experience increase during the game. When a ship
	    reaches a maximun it can upgrade to the next
	    level. This way it can get new arms, better defense
	    and more power. If a ship is upgraded, its state and
	    energy is restored to the maximun value.<br><br>
	    
	    The ships can get experience in any of the following ways:
	    
	  <p>
	    <b>In combat</b>, when a ship is reached by a shot,
	    destroying an enemy ship and conquering an enemy or
	    empty planet.<br>
	   
	    When a ship conquer a planet there is a probability to
	    received info from enemy (the coordinates of some
	    planet). This probability increase with ship's level.
	    
	  <p>
	    <b>Exploring</b>, Discovering new planets.
	    
	  <p>
	    <b>Training</b>: all ships with a level equal or
	    superior to 3 can train other ships. For training,
	    both ships must be in same planet and the pupil must
	    be landed. The master also must be two levels
	    superior.
	    
	  <p>
	    <b>Upgrade</b>: you can upgrade a ship (it cost
	    gold). You can only upgrade until one level below the
	    higher level reached for one of your ships.
	    
	    
	    <h3>Gold:</h3>
	    
	    <h4>There are several ways to obtain gold:</h4>
	  <p>
	    -Every tower in each planet gets gold until the planet
	    resources are finished. In this case they can still
	    obtain a little amount of gold. Increasing the number
	    of towers in every planet increased the amount of gold
	    obtained. Depending on the planet mass, there is a
	    limit in the number of towers in the same planet that
	    can obtain gold. For the big ones, this limit can be
	    four or five towers. For the little ones, three.
	    
	  <p>
	    -For each planet, every player gets a fix amount of
	    gold.
	    
	  <p>
	    -Destroying asteroids is another way to obtain gold.
	    
	  <p>
	    -All the ships destroyed inside a planet increase the
	    planet resources.
	  <p>
	    -And the last way: selling ships .
	    
	  <p><br>
	    
	    <h4>And there are also several ways to lost it:</h4>
	    
	  <p>
	    -All the ships, except the towers, have a cost. This
	    constant cost is increased when a ship is upgraded.
	    
	  <p>
	    -All the ammunition cost gold.
	    
	  <p>
	    -Repair and refuel a ship cost gold.
	    
	  <p>
	    -Buying, upgrading ships.

	    number of galaxies and the total number of
	    planets. Use the command line options: -l, -g and

	    <h3>Net gaming:</h3>
	    
	    For two players net game: one must be configured as
	    the server and the other one as the client. Use the
	    next command line options: <p>
	    
	    $ space -s -ip ipnumber <br>
	    
	    for the server, and <br><br>
	    
	    $ space -c -ip ipnumber <br>
	    
	    for the client. <p>
	    
	    where ipnumber is the IP number of the server.
	    
	  <p>
	    SpaceZero use the port 50100 by default. You can use
	    another port adding -port portnumber in the command
	    line. SpaceZero also use the next port, by default
	    50101.

	    <h3>Loading and saving games:</h3>
	    
	    &lt;Ctrl&gt;-s and &lt;Ctrl&gt;-l will save and load a game. Only two
	    games can be saved: one for single games and another one for a net
	    games.
	    <br>In a net game only the server can save and load games.

	    <h3>Pausing a game:</h3>
	    
	    &lt;Ctrl&gt;-p will paused the game.
	    
	    
	    <h3>Quitting a game:</h3>
	    
	    &lt;Ctrl&gt;-q will quit the game.
	    
	    <h3>Game Over:</h3>
	    
	    If you lost all your ships the game is over.
	  <p>
	    In queen mode game, if you lost the Queen Spaceship,
	    you lost the game.
	  <p>
	    When game is over, pressing the "f7" and
	    "f8" keys you can observe the other players
	    (in single games and in the server side).
	    
	    
	    
	    <h3>Tips:</h3>
	  <p>-Try to conquer all the inexplore planets as fast as
	    you can.
	  <p>-Don't buy more than two or three towers by planet
	    unless you need to defend the planet.</p>
	  <p>-Watch out your explorers, don't let them go too far.</p>
	  <p>-You can form groups of ships ordering to some of
	    them GOTO another ship. All of them will go where this
	    last one go.</p>
	  <p>-Save some gold. It would be useful if you are under attack.</p>
	  <p>-Use the ships of level three or superior to upgrade
	    the rest, especially the towers.</p>
